# ELAImageTester
Image Manipulation Tester using JPEG Error Level Analysis

## Introduction
This project focuses on finding edited areas of a JPEG image using Error Level Analysis (ELA). Although currently our program is not able to perfectly detect if an image is modified or not, it is able to detect and display areas that are possibly modified.

This project was a research project for Machine Vision course.
